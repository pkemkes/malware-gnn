# Master's Thesis: Malware Classification in Heterogeneous Graph Databases using Graph Neural Networks - Implementation

## Disclaimer:
This repository contains the code used for my Master's Thesis. It is not built to work on any data and highly depends on the data format used in the thesis. This repository contains detailed information on the format. Furthermore, this code still needs a lot of work to be generally usable for the public. The intention of publicizing it here is merely to show the inner workings of the thesis more clearly.

## Preconditions
- Install packages with `requirements.txt` and install torch with following commands:
``` bash
# run this with your pip (multiple 'find-links' don't work within requirements.txt)
pip install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio===0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
# cuda
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+cu113.html
# cpu:
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.10.0+cpu.html
```
- Add the location of this repository to your PYTHONPATH to make its modules available
- Get data in right format, see examples

## Steps:
- preprocess with preprocessing script
- train
- profit.
